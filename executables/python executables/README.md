  Today I will be going through yet another malware pretending to be an XPCheat.
  
  So, as always - let's start with [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)

 Let's put it through Module decomp, in this case it will be [Mysterium](https://github.com/venaxyt/mysterium) as it's the simplest for people without any special knowledge or skills.

 Head over to the dump generated by Mysterium and firstly look for "odd" things.

  Then locate .pyc / .pyd relating to your main executable name.

  Here you simply need to use [Uncompyle6](https://pypi.org/project/uncompyle6/) command on that pyc file, and in the CMD dump generated simply look for webhook
  which you can delete using [Webhook Remover](https://github.com/venaxyt/Discord-WebHook-Deleter).
  
  
  I'm not able to give you an good example, as this executable was made with the latest python ver as of now (3.11.0) and uncompyle6 goes only all the way up to Py 3.2
  
  However, if you want to see an example process, go ahead and watch [this video ðŸ‘»](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN3E3Hh5kuc)
