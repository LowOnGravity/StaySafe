# Account Recovery: How to have bigger chances

***To recover your account, you always have to prove that it belongs to you, and the best way of doing it is through screenshots and information that only
an active account owner would know***.

To be certain that you have better chances of getting your account back through E-mail, save this data of your account:

#

 **Always save past username after changing it**

  **Make a screenshot of Gold Purchase History**

 **Make a list of project & models name  that you own / created / published / are part of**

 **Screenshot your own profile from time to time, to have a comparison of changes after getting hacked**

-  *To reassure that you own this account, you can make such screenshot with your discord in background*
